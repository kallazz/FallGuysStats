# FallGuysStats
FallGuysStats allows you to add an entry after every game, making it easy to keep track of your stats. 

I created it shortly after the game was released. Initially, the purpose of this app was to monitor how frequently games were lost due to cheaters or bugs, which occurred way too often at the beginning. Later, I added additional features to better understand the game, such as counting team games, rounds, and tracking the types of final rounds.

I developed the app using 🐍Python and 📝Google Sheets API.
